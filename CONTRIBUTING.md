# Contributing to Formwork
👋 Thank you for being interested in Formwork! Issues and pull requests are always welcome.

➡️ Please take a moment to read these guidelines. The aim of this document is to keep contributors input always effective and manage the project as easily as possible.

## Submitting issues
Use the [**Issues tracker**](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/issues) for bug reports and feature requests. It shouldn't be used for other kinds of input. Always search for similar requests before opening a new issue.

🌍 If you want to translate Formwork in another language, submit a [**pull request**](#submitting-pull-requests) instead of an issue.

➡️ **Please use the Formwork channel on the [Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/5Q3BmNY) to request support and ask general questions about the project.**

### Bug reports
🐛 Good bug reports are extremely helpful. If you are going to send a bug report, please update Formwork before to be sure it's not already been fixed in recent releases. Always give context and instructions to replicate the problem.

### Feature requests
🌟 Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope of Formwork. **It's always up to you** convincing of the merits of the feature you're proposing.

## Submitting pull requests
Good pull requests such as patches, translations, improvements and new features are a valuable help. They should remain focused and avoid containing unrelated commits. Also remember they have to fit with the aims of the project.

➡️ **Please ask before** embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not be merged into Formwork.
